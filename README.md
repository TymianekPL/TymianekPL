I resigned as a programmer. It was a fantastic journey, but it's time for me to end it. 8 years is a significant amount of time, and the experience I gained could serve me well and land me in a really well-paid job. But today everything has changed and I no longer have any interest in making software. you can reach me out if you want to discuss anything else, I'm still myself. Just quit programming. Moreso, I have to focus on my mental health. I do intend to change my online presence, therefore I might seem like a different person.

Love, tym~
